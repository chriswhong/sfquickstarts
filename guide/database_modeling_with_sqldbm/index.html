      <google-codelab-step label="Use Case Overview" duration="3">
        <h2 is-upgraded>What is Database Modeling?</h2>
<p>An entity-relationship (ER) diagram is the traditional way of visualizing the tables and their relationships in a relational database. Having a diagram makes it easier to find relevant tables and gives the user an instantaneous idea of how tables can be joined for analytics purposes.</p>
<p>SqlDBM takes the ER diagram&#39;s visual, no-code approach and allows user to manipulate their database directly using the graphical perspective. Instead of writing DDL by hand, SqlDBM users can drag, drop, copy, and clone objects using an intuitive, browser-based graphical interface. Then, we take it a step further!</p>
<p>With SqlDBM, changes made on a diagram can be forward-engineered into neat, Snowflake-specific DDL and deployed back to the database. What&#39;s more, the tool leverages this intuitive, code-free approach to enable collaboration, documentation, and version control.</p>
<p>We&#39;ll go through all these features in detail as part of this Quickstart, so let&#39;s start by setting up our account.</p>

        <p>Let&#39;s organize our project by creating some subject areas. These serve as folders for keeping your diagrams organized. Then we&#39;ll learn to create and edit its properties, as well as add/copy fields.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="create a subject area and add tables" src="img/998db5ec07fc6b3.gif"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Create a Subject Area</h2>
<p>Subject areas serve as folders for keeping diagrams organized by categories such as department or project. Right-click on &#34;Subject Areas&#34; in the Diagrams screen and select &#34;Add a Subject Area.&#34;</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Add a table to a diagram</h2>
<p>Click on the &#34;Diagram Explorer&#34; button on the left-hand menu. Add a table to a diagram from the object catalog by searching for a part of its name, then click the &#34;Add to Diagram&#34; button next to it.</p>
<p>Type &#34;product&#34; into the search box to filter the list of tables and bring &#34;DimProduct&#34; onto the diagram.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="name table, add pk, copy columns" src="img/fca6e1839318b581.gif"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Create a new table</h2>
<p>Right-click anywhere on the canvas and select &#34;Add Table.&#34; Double-click on the new table to edit it. Give the table a name and add some columns with corresponding data types.</p>
<p>Table name: DimProductPrototype</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Copy columns from an existing table</h2>
<p>Select a column (or shift-click to select multiple) from an existing table and drag them to another table to move them. Perform the drag operation holding the Ctrl key (Command on Mac) to copy.</p>
<p>Highlight and drag several columns from DimProduct to DimProductPrototype</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Add a primary key (PK) to a table</h2>
<p>Double click on a table to enter edit mode. Create a new column at the topmost section to designate it as a primary key (replacing &#34;&lt;pk column name&gt;&#34;).</p>
<p>Alternatively, drag any existing column to the top of the table to designate it as a PK.</p>
<p>create a PK column for DimProductPrototype called ProductPrototypeKey of type Integer.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Add a foreign key (FK) to a table</h2>
<p>Click on a table that has a PK defined. Drag the bottom-right connector to another table to add it as an FK.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="add primary and foreign keys" src="img/b8347b3d5f28486d.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Create a child or parent table</h2>
<p>Select a table in the diagram. Use the top-left or bottom-right connectors to create a parent or child table, respectively.</p>
<p>Parent tables PKs will cascade to the child tables.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Create a template</h2>
<p>Templates save time by allowing you to define and reuse columns at your convenience.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="template" src="img/9c7521fd7e482b48.png"></p>
<p>Find &#34;Templates&#34; in the &#34;Database Explorer&#34; screen (third option from the top in the left-hand menu) and click to &#34;Create New.&#34;</p>
<p>Click on the newly created template to select it and set the Template Properties on the right-hand menu.</p>
<ul>
<li>Template name: give the template a descriptive name, like &#34;MetadataColumns,&#34; for example.</li>
<li>Apply to new tables: tick this option if you want this template to apply automatically to all newly created tables.</li>
<li>Columns: add the columns that you would like to be part of the template. Let&#39;s add EtlId as date and EtlName as varchar in this example. Be sure to provide a description.</li>
<li>Description: provide a general description for the template</li>
<li>Related tables: metadata showing which tables are currently associated with the existing template</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Assign a template to a table</h2>
<p>Let&#39;s assign the metadata columns from the template we just created to a table. Select a table to bring up its properties in the right-hand menu. Expand the &#34;Options&#34; menu and scroll down to the &#34;Templates&#34; text area.</p>
<p>Begin typing the template name and select it from the auto-suggestion. Hit &#34;Add&#34; to associate it with the table.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that while the association exists, changes to the template will be reflected in the associated tables. To break the association, click the &#34;X&#34; next to the template name in the table options; you will be given a choice to keep or delete the template columns in the process.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Working with primary and foreign keys" duration="2">
        <p>Although we covered the technical aspect of creating and assigning PK and FK constraints, their importance in a relational database deserves its own section. But first, a refresher:</p>
<ul>
<li>A primary key constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table.</li>
<li>Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values and can not contain NULL values.</li>
<li>A foreign key is a field (or collection of fields) in one table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.</li>
<li>The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called the referenced or parent table.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although Snowflake does not enforce PK and FK constraints (only NOT NULL) - meaning, Snowflake will not throw an error when duplicate records are inserted, thereby violating a PK - maintaining these as part of a schema helps users understand the tables and their relationships.</p>
<p>Being able to quickly and visually identify PK/FK constraints helps make sense of the data and facilitates joins and logical operations where uniqueness needs to be taken into account. SqlDBM uses PK/FK constraints to link and draws table relationships on a diagram, as do many BI tools when suggesting joins.</p>
<p>Observe the below tables, which have no constraints defined. Without probing the data, there is no way to determine the uniqueness of individual records or if common columns (i.e., Hotel_ID) hold the same data or use different formats.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="no constraints" src="img/187962172c51c8a0.png"></p>
<p>Now observe the same tables with corresponding PK/FK constraints declared. Instantly we know that a BOOKING_ID holds unique information about a booking in the bookings table and that the same is true of Hotel_ID in the hotels table.</p>
<p>We also know that we can join hotels to bookings using the Hotel_ID.</p>

<p>SqlDBM&#39;s <strong>Data Dictionary</strong> allows users to review and edit object-level comments in one centralized and searchable screen. The descriptions provided here are intended to help the team go beyond object definitions and provide meaningful details about the data contained in the tables.</p>
<p>The descriptions provided here will become part of the object DDL. They can be deployed back to the database (see Forward Engineering topic ahead) - they are not meant to serve merely as project metadata.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Access the Data Dictionary screen by selecting the book icon on the left-hand menu.</li>
<li>Use the search box to perform a wildcard lookup for objects, columns, and descriptions matching a given term.</li>
<li>Enter object-level or column-level descriptions in the description fields. By design, other DDL details such as object names, datatypes, and properties can not be changed on this screen. This allows users from any level of technical experience to contribute to a project without the possibility of changing any structural details.</li>
<li>Template descriptions - located at the bottom of the screen - can also be maintained here. Note that the description is displayed in related tables but can only be edited in the template itself.</li>
<li>The Import/Export to Excel buttons are located at the top-right of the screen. This allows users to contribute to a project by maintaining descriptions in a familiar Excel format without modifying the object structure.<ul>
<li>Click the &#34;Export to Excel&#34; button to generate and download the data dictionary in Excel format.</li>
<li>The Excel follows a similar format as the Data Dictionary screen: only the descriptions are editable (highlighted in orange). Modifying any other field (not highlighted in orange) will not affect the project but will fail to update the related description.</li>
<li>Once you have added some descriptions to the file, save it, and press the &#34;Upload&#34; button to incorporate the changes into the project.</li>

<li>Click on the &#34;Compare Revisions&#34; icon on the left-hand menu.</li>
<li>The latest two revisions are selected by default. Select any two revisions to see the cumulative changes between them. Changes are highlighted based on the following color scheme:</li>
</ol>
<table>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Color</p>
</td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Description</p>
</td></tr>
<tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p>Green</p>

        <p>The time has come to deploy all of the changes made during this exercise to a Snowflake environment.</p>
<p>In SqlDBM, DDL is generated through a function known as <strong>Forward Engineering</strong>. There are two options: create SQL and alter SQL. The first (create) generates a create statement for selected objects as of the latest revision. The second (alter) creates an alter script from a previous revision.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="forward engineer" src="img/84c7c8fb6e865a6d.png"></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Access the Forward Engineering screen by clicking on the scroll icon on the left-hand menu.</li>
</ol>
<h2 is-upgraded>Review Errors and Warnings</h2>
<p>While SqlDBM allows users to model and brainstorm at any level of detail (or lack thereof) with no impediment, it also offers non-intrusive &#34;Errors and Warnings&#34; alerts. While these notifications are available on the diagram and in Database Documentation, they are most relevant on the Forward Engineering screen.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the colored dot next to a table name to review any possible problems which may cause deployment errors (e.g., columns without a datatype or duplicate tables or column names).</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Errors and Warnings" src="img/246d543e05bb2a97.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Generate CREATE script</h2>
<p>This option will generate a &#34;create&#34; script for deploying new objects (or overwriting existing ones depending on the generation options).</p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>Mark the check-box for the objects that you wish to create or use the search to find the desired ones. Ensure that the &#34;Create&#34; option is selected for &#34;Schema&#34; if this is your first time deploying the project.</li>
<li>Set the <em>Generation Options</em> in the right-hand panel according to what you wish to deploy. Here you can mark options such as create, drop (or both, which results in <code>CREATE OR REPLACE</code>) for individual object types and set general properties like Safe Scripts or quote options (i.e., double or empty).</li>
<li>Hit the <em>Generate SQL</em> button in the middle of the screen or the <em>triangle</em> icon up top to generate the script.</li>
</ol>
<h2 is-upgraded>Generate ALTER script</h2>
<p>An Alter script will generate only the changes between the latest revision and a previous one. Create, drop, or alter statements will be generated automatically, based on which changes occurred between the selected revisions. As such, only the Safe Scripts and quoting options are applicable.</p>
<ul>
<li>Press the Generate Alter SQL button or the triangle+A icon as described in step [4].</li>
<li>Select the revision you wish to alter from. Typically, you would choose to alter from the last revision deployed to the database. If this is your first deployment, choose &#34;Revision 1&#34;.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Alter Script" src="img/26bceac271001b0.png"></p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Deploy changes</h2>
<p>Whether you are looking to perform a fresh deployment using a Create Script, or just the latest changes from an Alter Script, the final step is to review the changes before deployment.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Review Script" src="img/6f1ade999eca247.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to thoroughly review the generated script before deploying it to a database. While SqlDBm guarantees precise and well-formatted code, you should always review the final output to make sure you have selected the right objects and set the <em>Generation Options</em> accordingly.</li>
<li>Pay special attention to the objects with <em>Errors and Warnings</em> indicators and correct the issue where possible, as these are the most likely to cause deployment issues.</li>
<li>Once you&#39;ve verified your code, take the script back into Snowflake and paste it into a worksheet.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="deploy" src="img/335c4f2a1a65e4eb.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to set the active database and schema unless specified as part of the script.</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Snowflake Settings" src="img/c9a51dce745ace07.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>Run the script, and enjoy a job well done.</li>
</ul>

      <google-codelab-step label="Conclusion &amp; Next Steps" duration="4">
        <p>Visually guided database modeling can help an enterprise data team make sense of, and accelerate database development. In this Quickstart, we followed a simple development workflow: from creating and instantiating a new Snowflake project and schema, to making changes, all the way to deployment. However, the benefits of a centralized modeling tool extend well beyond the role of a developer.</p>
<p>Whether it&#39;s a project manager using <strong>Compare Revisions</strong> to track changes, a business user familiarizing themselves with a previously-unknown datamart through a relational diagram, or a new team-member becoming appraised of an organization through <strong>Database Documentation</strong> - doing this in a single tool and a coordinated fashion makes everyone&#39;s job easier and ensures consistency throughout.</p>
