        <p>This <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/understanding-snowflakes-resource-optimization-capabilities/" target="_blank">blog post</a> can provide you with a better understanding of Snowflake&#39;s Resource Optimization capabilities.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Performance</h2>
<p>The queries provided in this guide are intended to help you setup and run queries pertaining to identifying areas where poor performance might be causing excess consumption, driven by a variety of factors.</p>
<h2 class="checklist" is-upgraded>What You&#39;ll Learn</h2>
<ul class="checklist">
<li>how to identify areas in which performance can be improved</li>
<li>how to analyze workloads with poor performance causing excess consumption</li>
<li>how to identify warehouses that would benefit from scaling up or out</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>What You&#39;ll Need</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/" target="_blank">Snowflake</a> Account</li>
<li>Access to view <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage.html#enabling-account-usage-for-other-roles" target="_blank">Account Usage Data Share</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>Related Materials</h2>

<li>Resource Optimization: Usage Monitoring</li>
<li>Resource Optimization: Billing Metrics</li>
</ul>

      <google-codelab-step label="Query Tiers" duration="0">
        <p>Each query within the Resource Optimization Snowflake Quickstarts will have a tier designation just to the right of its name as &#34;(T*)&#34;.  The following tier descriptions should help to better understand those designations.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Tier 1 Queries</h2>
<p>At its core, Tier 1 queries are essential to Resource Optimization at Snowflake and should be used by each customer to help with their consumption monitoring - regardless of size, industry, location, etc.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Tier 2 Queries</h2>
<p>Tier 2 queries, while still playing a vital role in the process, offer an extra level of depth around Resource Optimization and while they may not be essential to all customers and their workloads, it can offer further explanation as to any additional areas in which over-consumption may be identified.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Tier 3 Queries</h2>
<p>Finally, Tier 3 queries are designed to be used by customers that are looking to leave no stone unturned when it comes to optimizing their consumption of Snowflake.  While these queries are still very helpful in this process, they are not as critical as the queries in Tier 1 &amp; 2.</p>

<h3 is-upgraded>Description:</h3>
<p>This query returns an aggregated daily summary of all loads for each table in Snowflake showing average file size, total rows, total volume and the ingest method (copy or snowpipe)</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>How to Interpret Results:</h3>
<p>With this high-level information you can determine if file sizes are too small or too big for optimal ingest. If you can map the volume to credit consumption you can determine which tables are consuming more credits per TB loaded.</p>
