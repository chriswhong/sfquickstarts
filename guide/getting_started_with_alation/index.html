        <p>Does your organization have data intelligence? Can people easily find, understand, and trust data? If not, you&#39;ll want to join this lab to learn how Alation ensures people have reliable and trustworthy data to make confident, data-driven decisions.</p>
<p>In this expert-led, hands-on lab, you will follow a step-by-step guide utilizing an Alation-provided sample database of a fictitious TV streaming company, Juno. Using this example data, you will learn how the Alation Data Catalog improves productivity with self-service analytics and uses automation and continuous improvement to manage data governance. See why Alation is Snowflake&#39;s <em>2-time Data Governance Partner of the Year</em>.</p>
<p>During the lab, you&#39;ll kickstart your 14-day free trial of Alation — to which you can connect to your own Snowflake environment and continue to explore the data catalog.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Establishing a Governance Framework" duration="5">
        <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>One of the best parts of using the Alation data intelligence platform is that you get a system to drive data culture and a wealth of knowledge on how to get started. Data Governance doesn&#39;t need to be a daunting undertaking. Let Alation help guide you using an active data governance methodology based on people first.</p>
<p>This section is all about how to get started and achieve value quickly from Alation—starting with curating assets to understanding common problems that most data organizations want to solve. Some challenges impact a particular role in an organization, and you will see how <strong>all roles</strong> benefit from the data intelligence platform solutions.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that we will be accessing an Alation-provided Snowflake account for this lab. At the conclusion of the lab, we&#39;ll discuss how to set up Alation to manage your own Snowflake data sources.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Identifying Policies" duration="10">
        <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>In today&#39;s world of data management, it is common to have policies and procedures that range from data quality and retention to personal data protection. If you are an organization that has policies defined, how difficult is it to find them? Often, policies are in file shares or document systems, making them very hard to discover. With Alation, you can store your policies where your data assets live, which makes them extremely easy to find. The other huge benefit is that data assets associated with the policy can be tracked.</p>

        <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>Every organization wants to make data-driven decisions. For this to become a reality, all employees must have the ability to quickly search data assets (databases, files, reports, etc.) to discover trusted data they can understand and use.</p>
<p>Alation creates an experience that allows users to expand their world of knowledge through curation and collaboration. A community of technical and non-technical producers and consumers helps drive data literacy, leading to better business decisions and success.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Compose" duration="15">
        <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the rich cataloging and governance capabilities, Alation enables users to interact with data stored in cataloged sources. This capability is called Compose and provides a fully integrated and governed SQL development environment.</p>
<p>Compose is more than your typical SQL editor. Because it is integrated with the catalog, the editor&#39;s IntelliSense can provide suggestions as you type for tables, columns, joins, etc. Another advantage is that active governance will show you when an item is deprecated, so you are not using bad data.</p>
<p>Queries can be developed by those who know SQL and shared with others in the organization. No worries if you don&#39;t know how to read or write SQL. Queries can be published as forms that allow the business user to fill out some prompts and get answers to the questions they need to be answered.</p>
