        <p>Modern businesses need modern data strategies, built on platforms that support agility, growth and operational efficiency.</p>
<p><a href="https://signup.snowflake.com/?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidsearch&utm_content=go-eta-ld-free-trial&utm_term=c-g-snowflake-e&utm_campaign=na-en-Branded&_bt=470247374327&_bk=snowflake&_bm=e&_bn=g&_bg=64805047909&gclid=Cj0KCQjw18WKBhCUARIsAFiW7JwA-C_HmNQzG_OFKhM1Hn9vlW6EAs-9mveiMXychVbbK34lh4vGfHsaAv4NEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds" target="_blank">Snowflake</a> is the Data Cloud, a future-proof solution that simplifies data pipelines, so you can focus on data and analytics instead of infrastructure management.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.getdbt.com/" target="_blank">dbt</a> is a transformation workflow that lets teams quickly and collaboratively deploy analytics code following software engineering best practices like modularity, portability, CI/CD, and documentation. Now anyone who knows SQL can build production-grade data pipelines. It transforms data in the warehouse, leveraging cloud data platforms like Snowflake.</p>
<p>In this Quickstart, you will follow a step-by-step guide to using dbt with Snowflake, and see some of the benefits this tandem brings.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s get started.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>What You&#39;ll Use During the Lab</h2>

      <google-codelab-step label="Architecture and Use Case Overview" duration="1">
        <p>In this lab, we are going to analyze the historical trading performance of a company that has trading desks spread across different regions. As inputs, we are going to leverage datasets available in Knoema Economy Data Atlas, which is available in Snowflake Data Marketplace. We&#39;ll also make use of a few manual uploads. To do this, we are going to set up the environments, build scalable pipelines in dbt, establish data tests , and promote code to production.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Architecture Overview" src="img/f6f4766b52a27108.png"></p>
<p>Just to give you a sneak peek, this is the data lineage we will be creating using dbt.</p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="DAG" src="img/619556ba8674abb2.png"></p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Snowflake Configuration" duration="1">
        <ol type="1">
<li>Login to your Snowflake trial account.<br><img alt="Snowflake Log In Screen" src="img/25919102cc7730a4.png"></li>
<li>UI Tour (SE will walk through this live). For post-workshop participants, click <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/snowflake-manager.html#quick-tour-of-the-web-interface" target="_blank">here</a> for a quick tour of the UI.</li>
</ol>
<p>We will be using the new UI to getting started but you can also switch over to the Classic Console if you would like. It will not affect your dbt experience but may change where the buttons are in the Snowflake UI.</p>
<p>New UI: <img alt="New Snowflake UI" src="img/8179fbbefc05bbf1.png"></p>
<p>Classic UI:</p>
<p><img alt="Snowflake Worksheets" src="img/a9e4874ee1809003.png"><br> If you ever want to change from the new UI to the classic one, click on the home button and then <code>Classic Console</code></p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Connect to Data Source" duration="5">
        <p>Now we need to obtain our raw data. We are going to the Snowflake Marketplace to connect to the Knoema dataset.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We want to go into the Snowflake Marketplace to connect to the Knoema dataset. Click on Data on the left hand sidebar and then Marketplace.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Click on Marketplace" src="img/8b1a6f4d7c7bf458.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>Now let&#39;s look for Knoema Economy Atlas Data. Type into the &#34;Search Data Marketplace&#34; search bar &#34;Knoema Economy Atlas Data&#34;.  Find the Knoema Economy Atlas Data tile in the results. Once you find it, click on it.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Click on Knoema Tile" src="img/76cb43b0f2a808c2.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="6">
<li>You should now on a page with a description of the data, sample queries, and other useful information. Let&#39;s get this data into our Snowflake account. Click the &#34;Get Data&#34; button.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Click on Get Data" src="img/a869b2bf88892059.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="7">
<li>In the pop-up, enter &#34;KNOEMA_ECONOMY_DATA_ATLAS&#34; as the database name and click &#34;Get Data&#34;. Do not forget to update the name of the database or you will have update some code down the line.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Rename Database" src="img/9531b7be6a185d9.png"></p>
<p>So what is happening here? Knoema has granted access to this data from their Snowflake account to yours. You&#39;re creating a new database in your account for this data to live - but the best part is that no data is going to move between accounts! When you query, you&#39;ll really be querying the data that lives in the Knoema account. If they change the data, you&#39;ll automatically see those changes. No need to define schemas, move data, or create a data pipeline either.</p>
<ol type="1" start="8">
<li>Click on Query Data.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Click on Query Data" src="img/3d5d54ded7038c1d.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="9">
<li>Now let&#39;s look at the new data. On the left hand sidebar, you should see KNOEMA_ECONOMY_DATA_ATLAS listed as a database. If not, refresh the UI and check again.</li>
<li>Now let&#39;s try to query the data. If you want to switch back to the original interface, you can click on the home button on the top left and then <code>Classic Console</code> on the bottom of the left hand sidebar. This will port you back where you can see the database displayed the way it was before.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Economy Atlas comes with more than 300 datasets. In order to improve navigation, the data provider has kindly supplied a table called DATASETS. Let&#39;s go ahead and find the ones related to the stock history and currency exchange rates that we are going to use in the next step.</p>
<ol type="1" start="11">
<li>Remove the code in the worksheet and paste in this code.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">select * 
  from &#34;KNOEMA_ECONOMY_DATA_ATLAS&#34;.&#34;ECONOMY&#34;.&#34;DATASETS&#34;
 where &#34;DatasetName&#34; ILIKE &#39;US Stock%&#39;
    OR &#34;DatasetName&#34; ILIKE &#39;Exchange%Rates%&#39;;
</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Query Knoema" src="img/3e834bf5607cd561.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="12">
<li>Now we can see what our datasets names are, let&#39;s try to query one of the datasets:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">select * 
  from KNOEMA_ECONOMY_DATA_ATLAS.ECONOMY.USINDSSP2020
 where &#34;Date&#34; = &#39;2020-02-03&#39;;
</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Query Knoema" src="img/4aa7bce6e0404b06.png"></p>
<p>Congratulations! You successfully tapped into a live data feed of Trade and FX rates data with NO ETL involved. Isn&#39;t this cool? Now let&#39;s start building our pipelines.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="dbt Configuration" duration="2">
        <p>Now it&#39;s time to set up dbt. We are going to be using <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/ecosystem-partner-connect.html" target="_blank">Snowflake Partner Connect</a> to set up your dbt Cloud account and project. Using this method will allow you to spin up a fully fledged dbt account with your <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/connecting-your-database#connecting-to-snowflake" target="_blank">Snowflake connection</a>, <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/cloud-using-a-managed-repository" target="_blank">managed repository</a>, <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/guides/managing-environments" target="_blank">environments</a>, and credentials in minutes.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In the Snowflake UI, click on the home icon on the top left side. To access Partner Connect, click on your user and then Partner Connect. Make sure you&#39;re still set as the ACCOUNTADMIN role.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Click on Partner Connect" src="img/9b35b63baff3a831.png"></p>
<p>If you&#39;re using the classic console, it will be on the top right. <img alt="Click on Partner Connect" src="img/4834f675346d24df.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>Find the dbt Tile by typing into the &#34;Search Partner Connect&#34; search bar. Click on the dbt tile.</li>
<li>You should now see a popup that says <code>Connect to dbt</code>. Click on <code>Optional Grant</code> and you are going to add in the KNOEMA_ECONOMY_DATA_ATLAS database. This will grant access for your new dbt user role to the database.</li>
<li>Click on <code>Connect</code>. This will create a dedicated dbt user, database, warehouse, and role for your dbt Cloud trial.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Click on Connect" src="img/2e72af80f8e517c4.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="5">
<li>When the popup that says &#34;Your partner account has been created&#34;, click on activate. <img alt="Click on Partner Activate" src="img/7caf37d48ae26027.png"></li>
<li>You should be redirected to a dbt Cloud registration page. Fill out the form. Make sure to save the password somewhere for login in the future.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Register dbt Cloud account" src="img/836c7a78edc4093e.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="7">
<li>Click on Compete Registration. You should now be redirected to your dbt Cloud account, complete with a connection to your Snowflake account, a deployment and a development environment, and even a sample job.</li>
</ol>
<p>To help you version control your dbt project, we have connected it to a <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/cloud-using-a-managed-repository" target="_blank">managed repository</a>, which means that dbt Labs will be hosting your repository for you. This will give you access to a git workflow without you having to create and host the repository yourself. You will not need to know git for this workshop; dbt Cloud will help guide you through the workflow. In the future, when you&#39;re developing your own project, feel free to use <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/cloud-configuring-dbt-cloud/cloud-installing-the-github-application" target="_blank">your own repository</a>. This will allow you to play with features like <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/cloud-enabling-continuous-integration-with-github" target="_blank">Slim CI</a> builds after this workshop.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="dbt Project Configuration" duration="5">
        <ol type="1">
<li>Now let&#39;s set up our dbt project. Click on the hamburger menu on the top left side and click on <code>Develop</code>.  This will spin up your IDE (Integrated Development Environment) where you will be developing your dbt Project.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Click on the hamburger" src="img/743ced9ac9218105.png"><img alt="Click on the develop" src="img/d36ddb9756ec1db.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>After the IDE loads, click <code>Initialize your project</code> to set up your dbt project. Once you click on it, dbt will generate our starter project with the core files and folders. <img alt="Click on the Initialize" src="img/a3b8e171641b262a.png"></li>
<li>You should see new files and folders created in your file tree. These are all the files and folders you will need for a dbt project. Take a look around, especially at the <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt_project.yml" target="_blank">dbt_project.yml</a> and what&#39;s in the <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models" target="_blank">models</a> directory.</li>
<li>Click <code>Commit</code>. Enter a commit message, and then click <code>Commit</code> again to commit your work to your master branch.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="Click on the commit" src="img/d894e24773b47eca.png"><img alt="commit message" src="img/fe6b013fcf37dbdb.png"></p>
<p>Commit messages should always be indicative of the work you are saving. This helps you create a reference point for the future in case of auditing and debugging.  By <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-commit#:~:text=The%20git%20commit%20command%20captures,you%20explicitly%20ask%20it%20to." target="_blank">committing</a>, you are saving to a remote branch in Github. This will also be the only time you will save straight to your master branch (which is the main branch). We always want to create a degree of separation from development work and your production branch.</p>
<ol type="1" start="6">
<li>Click <code>create new branch</code> to check out a new git branch to start developing. <img alt="create branch" src="img/c76ec8fae2794a1e.png"></li>
<li>Name the branch &#34;dbt_snowflake_workshop&#34; and click <code>Submit</code>. <img alt="name branch" src="img/36bc6b7917d57390.png"></li>
<li>UI walkthrough (SA will walk through during the workshop). Post workshop, users can look at <a href="https://getdbt.wistia.com/medias/0828jynq3v" target="_blank">this video for the walkthrough</a>.</li>
<li>Now let&#39;s validate that everything was initialized correctly by running the sample models that come with the starter dbt project.</li>
<li>Type in <code>dbt run</code> on the command line at the bottom, and click <code>Enter</code>. The command line is where you will be entering in dbt commands to execute dbt actions.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to see the actual code being executed, you can go into the ‘Details&#39; tab next to <code>Summary</code> and look through the logs. Here you can see that dbt is writing the DDL for you, allowing you to focus on just writing the SQL select statement.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="dbt run" src="img/235dfcd5cc82494a.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="11">
<li>The output should look like below, confirming dbt was able to connect to Snowflake and successfully execute the sample models in the models folder:</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="successful run" src="img/14453157084ea6b9.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="12">
<li>If you want to see what is executed against Snowflake, click into one of the model tabs and click on details. You will see the log of the compiled code and how dbt interacted with Snowflake. Note that dbt by default built all of your models into this development schema made up of your first initial and last name. We will cover more environments later on.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="successful run" src="img/f922a258819206f8.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="13">
<li>Now let&#39;s visually confirm the objects in Snowflake. Switch to the Snowflake UI (classic console) and refresh database objects. Expand the database <code>PC_DBT_WH</code>. Then the development schema with your first initial and last name. And lastly Tables and Views. You should see the table <code>MY_FIRST_DBT_MODEL</code>  and the view <code>MY_SECOND_DBT_MODEL</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="successful run" src="img/299fd7e9642a3a88.png"></p>
<p>Congratulations! You just ran your first dbt models on Snowflake!</p>
<p>We are going to start by adding a few more things to our dbt project configuration in order to improve maintainability.</p>
<ol type="1" start="14">
<li>Let&#39;s add in some folders to follow our dimensional modeling structure. To learn more about how we structure our project, <a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-structure-our-dbt-projects/355" target="_blank">check out this discourse post</a>.  To add new folders, ghost over the models directory in the file tree and click on the ‘...&#39; on the right next to the models directory. Click on &#34;New Folder&#34; and type into it &#34;staging&#34;. Click &#34;Create&#34; after you finish typing and you should see a new folder in the file tree.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="create folder" src="img/53e3f249e0e18a3a.png"><img alt="create folder" src="img/9ece2656acb74f5d.png"><img alt="create folder" src="img/6fdd1ec32cd93a5b.png"><img alt="create folder" src="img/8aef6df671963301.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="15">
<li>Now that you&#39;ve gotten one completed, let&#39;s go ahead and create three more folders. First create a folder named &#34;knoema&#34; in the staging model by clicking on the ‘...&#39; next to the staging folder. This will be where we will put our staging models specific to our knoema source.</li>
<li>Now for our last folders, we are actually going to create two folders at once. Click on the ‘...&#39; next to models again. This time, we are going to fill the file path as &#34;models/marts/core&#34;. This will create a new folder under models called marts and in it, a folder called core.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should have a file tree that looks like this after completing this task.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="create folder" src="img/76d38060aedf8311.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="17">
<li>Next, let&#39;s update the <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt_project.yml" target="_blank">dbt_project.yml file</a>. This is a file that tells dbt that the repository is a dbt project as well as how to operate on your project. Click on the file <code>dbt_project.yml</code>. The first thing we are going to do is update the project name from &#34;my_new_project&#34; to &#34;&lt;your_name&gt;_dbt_workshop&#34; at line 5. This will personalize the project a little, and make it yours.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do not forget to save after you have updated the file! This means you will want to either click save or use cmd+s (mac)/ctrl+s(pc). The IDE will also warn you with the teal button on the tab.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="update project" src="img/b40022f8e8d6e895.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="18">
<li>Now let&#39;s update the models section in the file by declaring our new folders and their model configurations. We will be declaring the default <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-custom-schemas" target="_blank">schema</a> that dbt builds the object into, the default <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/materializations" target="_blank">materialization</a>, and disabling any unnecessary models from a run. All of these configurations can be overridden by model configurations on the model file. If a schema is not declared via a configuration, dbt will build into the default schema declared on our development credentials.</li>
</ol>
<p>Copy code below and paste into line 34 to line 38. Remember to replace &lt;your_name&gt;.</p>
<pre><code language="language-yml" class="language-yml">models:
  &lt;your_name&gt;_dbt_workshop:
      example:
          schema: example 
      staging:
          schema: staging
          materialized: view
      marts:
          schema: marts
          materialized: table
</code></pre>
<ol type="1" start="19">
<li>Save the file.</li>
<li>Be sure to click on &#34;Commit&#34; using the git command button (just in case your computer spontaneously explodes into a blob of smoke and melted plastic) to save your work. And supply a good commit message that conveys what you are saving!</li>
<li>To better understand how schema names work in dbt, let&#39;s take a look at the standard <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/jinja-macros" target="_blank">macro</a> that <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-custom-schemas" target="_blank">dbt uses to define what schema to build your object into</a>. By default, dbt is generating a schema name by appending it to the target schema environment name(dev, prod). If you ever want to override this, you are going to create a new file in the macros folder named <code>generate_schema_name.sql</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="schema macro" src="img/d1c85515f81c69e1.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="22">
<li>Copy and paste the below code into file generate_schema_name.sql to generate the macro.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">{% macro generate_schema_name(custom_schema_name, node) -%}

    {%- set default_schema = target.schema -%}
    {%- if custom_schema_name is none -%}

        &#123;&#123; default_schema }}

    {%- else -%}

        &#123;&#123; default_schema }}_&#123;&#123; custom_schema_name | trim }}

    {%- endif -%}

{%- endmacro %}

</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="schema macro" src="img/437c9ffdf2cc8a2f.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="23">
<li>Click Save</li>
<li>To see this macro in action, do another <code>dbt run</code> on the command line. Note how the schema has changed to be appending the custom schema name to our default schema per our macro. You can add in more <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/using-custom-schemas#jinja-context-available-in-generate_schema_name" target="_blank">conditionals</a> to fit your own needs in terms of environment promotions.</li>

<p>In this workshop, we will show you how different configurations can easily change how and where your dbt project reads and writes from without needing you to change your code with code promotion.</p>
<p>Macros are a way to do this. Macros are written in a pythonic templating language called <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/jinja-macros" target="_blank">Jinja</a>. Jinja allows you to do things that normally aren&#39;t possible in SQL such as create control structures (like if statements and for loops) or abstract away snippets of SQL into reusable functions applicable throughout your project. Jinja helps you write <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself" target="_blank">DRY</a> code in a language that is generally wet.</p>
<p>In this generate_schema_name macro, we are defining what schema your objects should be built into based on the conditionals specified. Going through the macro, what is happening here:</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">   {%- set default_schema = target.schema -%}
    {%- if custom_schema_name is none -%}
 
        &#123;&#123; default_schema }}
</code></pre>
<p>Is that we are defining our default schema as the target database and schema defined for your development environment. The Partner Connect flow sets up our development environment to point to the partner connect created database and a schema made of your first initial and last name. You can verify this in your <a href="https://cloud.getdbt.com/#/profile" target="_blank">profile</a>. However, if a custom schema is provided as we did in our dbt_project.yml file, dbt will build into a schema that is a concatenation of our default schema and the custom schema name due to this logic:</p>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">{%- else -%}

    &#123;&#123; default_schema }}_&#123;&#123; custom_schema_name | trim }}

{%- endif -%}
</code></pre>
<p>All of this logic is defined in one place and will be applied on your project which makes it simple to scale up your project, especially as business needs arise.</p>
<p>Later on, we will learn how to use macros from a package and see how those macros help us write SQL quickly.</p>
<ol type="1" start="25">
<li>Now we need to apply another operational macro. This time, this macro will add a <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/snowflake-configs#query-tags" target="_blank">query tag</a> for every dbt run in the Snowflake history.  To do this, we&#39;ll create a file in the &#34;macros&#34; folder called <code>query_tag.sql</code>.</li>
<li>Copy and paste the following code. This provides the ability to add an additional level of transparency by automatically setting Snowflake query_tag to the name of the model it is associated with.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">{% macro set_query_tag() -%}
  {% set new_query_tag = model.name %} {# always use model name #}
  {% if new_query_tag %}
    {% set original_query_tag = get_current_query_tag() %}
    &#123;&#123; log(&#34;Setting query_tag to &#39;&#34; ~ new_query_tag ~ &#34;&#39;. Will reset to &#39;&#34; ~ original_query_tag ~ &#34;&#39; after materialization.&#34;) }}
    {% do run_query(&#34;alter session set query_tag = &#39;{}&#39;&#34;.format(new_query_tag)) %}
    &#123;&#123; return(original_query_tag)}}
  {% endif %}
  &#123;&#123; return(none)}}
{% endmacro %}

<ol type="1" start="27">
<li>Click &#34;Save&#34;.</li>

<p class="image-container"><img alt="query tags" src="img/41a4d5c2e6164be3.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="28">
<li>Now, do a <code>dbt run</code> again on the command line.</li>
<li>To see where the query tags are applied, go to the Snowflake UI, click the &#34;History&#34; icon on top. You are going to see all the SQL queries you&#39;ve run on your Snowflake account (successful, failed, running etc.). and clearly see which dbt model a  particular query is related to.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="query tags" src="img/2da5145f6e90e7b9.png"></p>
<p>Update the Filter to the user is PC_DBT_USER and the status is Succeeded to see the same view as the screenshot above, you can also remove extra columns by clicking on the arrow after hovering over a column, hovering over &#34;Columns&#34; and unchecking any columns you don&#39;t want.</p>
<ol type="1" start="30">
<li>Now we are going to install a dbt package. A dbt <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/package-management" target="_blank">package</a> is essentially a dbt project that you can install onto your own dbt project to gain access to the code and use it as your own. Many of our packages are hosted on the <a href="https://hub.getdbt.com/" target="_blank">dbt Packages Hub</a>. In our lab, we are going to demonstrate how to use some useful macros in the dbt_utils package to write some complex SQL. To install it, create a file called <code>packages.yml</code> at the same level as your <code>dbt_project.yml</code> file.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="packages" src="img/ba188714cb524399.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="31">
<li>Copy and paste the following code into file packages.yml.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code language="language-yml" class="language-yml">packages:
  - package: dbt-labs/dbt_utils
    version: 0.8.0
</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="packages" src="img/39676f23a14a1c5b.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="32">
<li>Click <code>Save</code>.</li>
<li>Now we are going to install the package. By running <code>dbt deps</code>, you tell dbt to install the packages. With a successful run, you can check out the dbt_modules folder to see what packages you have installed and the code that is now available to you. <img alt="packages" src="img/abb41b971e3f10d0.png"></li>
<li>Last thing to do before we save our work. Remove the example subdirectory configuration in the <code>dbt_project.yml</code> file and delete the example folder with the models in it.</li>
<li>Click <code>Commit</code> to commit your work!</li>
</ol>

      <google-codelab-step label="Building dbt Data Pipelines" duration="1">
        <p>Now we start to get into the fun stuff. In the next few sections, we are going to build our dbt pipelines. This will include transformations that define these these areas of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stock trading history</li>
<li>Currency exchange rates</li>
<li>Trading books</li>
<li>Profit &amp; Loss calculation</li>

        <h3 is-upgraded>Setting up our Sources</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Now let&#39;s head back to the dbt Cloud IDE. We are going to start building our pipelines by declaring our <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/using-sources" target="_blank">dbt sources</a>.  Create a <code>knoema_sources.yml</code> file in the staging/knoema folder.</li>
<li>Paste in the following code.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code language="language-yml" class="language-yml">version: 2

sources:
  - name: knoema_economy_data_atlas
    database: knoema_economy_data_atlas

      - name: usindssp2020
</code></pre>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="sources" src="img/3eba45ceca02a4.png"></p>
<p>As you might remember, these two objects were mentioned in the Knoema Dataset Catalog table: daily exchange rates and daily US trading history accordingly.</p>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>Click <code>Commit</code> and provide a good commit message like &#34;set up knoema source file&#34;. We are going to keep building that muscle of saving your work as you develop.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now we have defined the sources that we will be building our dbt models on top of. By declaring these, we are able to create lineage from our raw objects to our transformed objects and apply documentation and testing.</p>
<h3 is-upgraded>Setting up our Staging Models</h3>
<ol type="1" start="4">
<li>Now let&#39;s create staging models to clean up our raw objects. Staging models bear a one-to-one relationship with the source data table they represent. They have the same granularity, but the columns have been renamed, recast, or reconsidered in some way to follow a consistent, useful format. By creating these as the first level transformation, you can create a consistent foundation to build more complex transformations upon. To learn more, check out our <a href="https://discourse.getdbt.com/t/how-we-structure-our-dbt-projects/355#data-transformation-101-1" target="_blank">discourse post</a>. The first staging model we are going to make will be for exratescc2018. Create a new file in the staging/knoema folder named <code>stg_knoema_fx_rates.sql</code>.</li>
<li>Paste the following select statement.</li>

<ol type="1" start="6">
<li>Save the file. To check the query before executing the code against the warehouse, you can click on the <code>Preview</code> button. You can also click on <code>Compile</code> to see the compiled code that will be executed.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="staging" src="img/777bf07838345f33.png"></p>
<p>In the compiled code, you will notice that the source function (&#123;&#123;source(‘knoema_economy_data_atlas&#39;,‘exratescc2018&#39;)}})  compiles to the actual database object.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s talk more about this function:</p>
<p>Using the sources function allows you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tell dbt how a model relates to its source and then dynamically generate a DAG from this, as you can see in the lineage tab</li>
</ul>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="staging" src="img/3ce1468ead5c8e35.png"></p>
<ul>
<li>This also allows dbt to dynamically replace the sources with their <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/target" target="_blank">target-specific name</a>, whether it&#39;s from the configuration in sources.yml or from the environment. This allows you to promote the same code from dev to prod and any other environments without having to change the code. You can even use the <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/target#use-targetname-to-change-your-source-database" target="_blank">target jinja function</a> to conditionally point to different databases based on the declared target.</li>

<li>Now let&#39;s create these views in Snowflake. Since we only want to run the models in the staging folder, we are going to use the following command on the command line:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>dbt run --select staging.*</code></p>
<p>This allows us to be selective and only run the models in the staging folder. <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/node-selection/syntax" target="_blank">Node selectors</a> are very helpful in refining what we actually want to run and test.</p>

<li>Once everything ran successfully, let&#39;s save our work to our remote branch. Click on <code>Commit</code> and provide a good commit message like &#34;set up staging models&#34;</li>
<li>Now we can go and query this dataset to take a feel of what the data profile looks like. You can either put this query in the &#34;Statement 1&#34; tab or in Snowflake UI. Remember to change the schema name to the correct one for you.</li>

<p>What did you think of the difference? While both models create the same end result, the <a href="https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-utils#pivot-source" target="_blank">dbt_utils.pivot macro</a> requires less code and less brainpower. All you had to do is fill in the columns and the model to obtain the same end result. It is also more dynamic, automatically updating at compilation if a new value appears.</p>
<p>You might have also noticed that in these models we are using a function called <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref" target="_blank">ref</a>. This ref function is very similar to sources function but rather than telling dbt how a model relates to a source declared in the sources.yml file, the ref function tells dbt how a model relates to another model. It&#39;s useful in the same reasons as sources():</p>
<ul>
<li>You will be able to automatically generate a DAG and promote your code through environments without having to update the code to change the database object.</li>
<li>Refs also allow you to run based on dependencies as you will see below.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main takeaway to remember is in a dbt project, you should never have to hardcode a database object. Always uses <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/using-sources" target="_blank">sources()</a> and <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-jinja-functions/ref" target="_blank">refs()</a></p>
<ol type="1" start="7">
<li>Now let&#39;s go ahead and create the new models in Snowflake. In this case, rather than running based on the model file, we will run based on dependencies. Run the following command to execute the int_knoema_stock_history model and its parent models.</li>
</ol>
<p><code>dbt run --select +int_knoema_stock_history</code></p>
<p>You should see that we have run all of the nodes (excluding sources) to the left of this lineage.</p>

<p>There&#39;s now a model configuration on top of our model. dbt offers <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/building-models/materializations" target="_blank">various materialization options</a>. By default, if a materialization is not declared, the model will be created as a view. For this directory (marts) that the model is nested in, we have configured in our <code>dbt_project.yml</code> that the default materialization is <code>table</code>. We will override the project level materialization with our model configuration, declaring the model to be materialized as a view. We also include a <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/tags" target="_blank">tag</a>. Tags can be used to run parts of your project or a good way to group your models based on content and intent.</p>
<ol type="1" start="10">
<li>Let&#39;s try running this model based on a tag. In the command line, run :</li>

<p>Now that we have created a few models, let&#39;s talk about <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/documentation" target="_blank">dbt documentation</a>. dbt is able to generate a static webpage with a data dictionary by pulling in information from your dbt project as well as your Snowflake information_schema. It also provides an interactive DAG so you can see the full lineage of your models; this is something you might have also noticed  in the lineage tab of the IDE. This is a fantastic way to share  information with your internal teams, as it contains all-important information about columns, tags, free-form model description, tests as well as the source code that is always in line with the code. So regardless of how big your project grows, it is super easy to understand what&#39;s happening with the help of dbt&#39;s documentation.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To generate your documentation site, execute &#34;dbt docs generate&#34; on the command line:</li>
</ol>
<p><code>dbt docs generate</code></p>

<li>Click on <code>View Docs</code> on the top left side.</li>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Testing &amp; Documentation</h2>
<p>To build trust in data with your organization, it is impossible to overstate the importance of testing and documentation. While there are many ways to organize automated testing and documentation, dbt comes with an accessible <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests" target="_blank">data testing</a> and <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/documentation" target="_blank">documentation</a> framework.</p>
<p>For tests, dbt comes with a set of 4 pre-defined data tests:</p>
<ul>
<li>uniqueness</li>
<li>not_null</li>
<li>check constraints</li>
<li>relationship integrity</li>
</ul>
<p>We are going to set up tests on a few models for this workshop. However, we strongly recommend you establish reasonable test coverage across the board. Adding your own tests is easy; as long as it can be written as a select statement, you can use it as a test. And just like with macros, there are plenty of fantastic packages out there like the <a href="https://hub.getdbt.com/calogica/dbt_expectations/latest/" target="_blank">dbt_expectations</a> package that provides tests similar to the <a href="http://greatexpectations.io/" target="_blank">Great Expectations</a> open source project.</p>
<p>For documentation, dbt takes model and column descriptions and will add them to the documentation site so that you have even more information about your models to share with your stakeholders via the site. It also pulls in information from the Snowflake information schema for a one stop show about your data project.</p>
<p>Now let&#39;s add testing and documentation to this project.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="dbt pipelines - Deployment" duration="5">
        <p>Okay, it seems like we have everything in place: pipelines have been developed, tested and documented.</p>
<p>The next step would be to promote this code up the chain through our environments (which in this lab are simplified to just DEV &amp; PROD). We&#39;ll do this by committing the work to our feature branch into the main branch and setting up a job to orchestrate the execution of the models in production. Generally it would be best for a pull request to be opened, so that your code is reviewed and tested via <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/cloud-enabling-continuous-integration-with-github#slim-ci" target="_blank">Slim CI</a> prior to promotion to production, but in the interest of keeping things concise for this workshop, we are going to merge into production without review.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>To do this, the first thing you are going to do is commit any remaining work you haven&#39;t yet.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="deploy" src="img/b515cea07cf1e6f3.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="2">
<li>Now we are going to click merge to master <img alt="deploy" src="img/f973e7c0643a2df9.png"></li>
</ol>
<p>By merging into master, you should have reverted back to your master branch for you to start the cycle over again for development.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="deploy" src="img/35aa09a5c16be611.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="3">
<li>Now we are going to deploy our code via dbt Cloud. Luckily for you, Partner Connection has already created your Production Environment for you. Now all we have to do is update some defaults.</li>
</ol>
<p>Click on the hamburger menu and click on <code>Environments</code>.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="deploy" src="img/495518f3e6f114f7.png"><img alt="deploy" src="img/43c557a087a4003d.png"></p>
<p>You should see two different Environments: Development and Deployment.</p>
<ol type="1" start="4">
<li>Click on the <code>Deployment</code> environment and then click on <code>Settings</code> in the top right.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="deploy" src="img/e8e0d24095155dc2.png"><img alt="deploy" src="img/eb05b651820003e6.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="5">
<li>We are going to update the schema name from your development schema to <code>production</code>. To do this, click on Edit.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="deploy" src="img/dd9e08389e820b0a.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="6">
<li>After you update the field, be sure to click on <code>Save</code> at the top. Now in doing this, dbt will default to building in a schema named <code>production</code> in the declared default database pc_dbt_db. This helps us separate out the objects we create in our production environment from our development sandbox.</li>
<li>After saving your environment, let&#39;s update the default Partner Connect created job. To do this, click on the hamburger menu on the top left and click on <code>Jobs</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="deploy" src="img/b8fcd73d8a19d345.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="8">
<li>Now select the pre-configured job named <code>Partner Connect Trial Job</code>.</li>
<li>Now let&#39;s edit it by first going to <code>Settings</code>.</li>
<li>Click on <code>Edit</code> on the top right.</li>
<li>And now we are going to update a few things. Change the name of the Job to <code>Production Job</code> to signify that this is going to be your production run. Update the number of <a href="https://docs.getdbt.com/dbt-cli/configure-your-profile#understanding-threads" target="_blank">threads</a> to 8. This will allow dbt to run 8 dbt models in the DAG concurrently sans dependencies. 8 is the default we recommend for Snowflake.</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="deploy" src="img/cc101238b715a131.png"></p>
<ol type="1" start="12">
<li>Because the dbt commands section already include the sequence of commands that we need things to operate, we are going to keep it as is. We want to seed our manual uploads to our production schema first. Then we want to create our objects in our schema prior to running tests on them. We are also going to leave the scheduling on it&#39;s default off configuration because we will be manually kicking off the job for this workshop.</li>
<li>Now go to the top and click <code>Save</code>.</li>
<li>Then click on the job name in the path on top. This will return you to the job run history page, from where you can click on <code>Run now</code>.</li>
<li>Click into the run to check out how the run is going. Your run should be successful like this after completion. <img alt="deploy" src="img/459b6b1e696173fb.png"></li>
<li>Take a look at the various run steps. You can validate that on the dbt run step, you are building into the prod schemas as noted in our environment configuration.</li>
<li>Verify  in Snowflake UI that you now we have data in the production schema:</li>
</ol>
<p class="image-container"><img alt="deploy" src="img/8b8b30073fbacf6d.png"></p>
<p>And this concludes our workshop! If you&#39;re interested in exploring further, there are &#34;extra credit&#34; tasks in the appendix of this workshop, in which you&#39;ll cover things like how to visualize what you&#39;ve created with Snowsight.</p>

        <h2 is-upgraded>Visualizations</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>If you want to create a simple data visualization for this dataset, we can use Snowsight. To do that, let&#39;s click on the Preview App button once again:</li>
<li>Enable the Dashboards and worksheets.</li>
<li>Then click Worksheets -&gt; + Worksheet to add a new one.</li>
<li>Copy and paste the following query in the worksheet.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code language="language-sql" class="language-sql">select * 
from pc_dbt_db.&lt;dev_schema&gt;_marts.int_daily_position_with_trades
where trader = &#39;Tina M.&#39;
order by  book_date
</code></pre>
<ol type="1" start="5">
<li>Hit the run button and switch from a table view to chart.</li>
<li>By default it shows a breakdown by Volume. Click on the measure and switch it into PNL.</li>
<li>Click &#34;+Add column&#34; to add another measure and select &#34;Market Value&#34; to display Market value and PnL side by side.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that&#39;s it! Now you have a worksheet that you can slice and dice, share with your colleagues or embed in the SnowSight dashboard as a tile. For more details on SnowSight, please refer to the Snowflake documentation.</p>
