        <p>This resource optimization guide represents one module of the four contained in the series. These guides are meant to help customers better monitor and manage their credit consumption. Helping our customers build confidence that their credits are being used efficiently is key to an ongoing successful partnership. In addition to this set of Snowflake Quickstarts for Resource Optimization, Snowflake also offers community support as well as Training and Professional Services offerings. To learn more about the paid offerings, take a look at upcoming <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/education-and-training/" target="_blank">education and training</a>.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/blog/understanding-snowflakes-resource-optimization-capabilities/" target="_blank">blog post</a> can provide you with a better understanding of Snowflake&#39;s Resource Optimization capabilities.</p>
<p>Contact our team at <a href="mailto:marketing@snowflake.com" target="_blank">marketing@snowflake.com</a>, we appreciate your feedback.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Usage Monitoring</h2>
<p>Usage Monitoring queries are designed to identify the warehouses, queries, tools, and users that are responsible for consuming the most credits over a specified period of time.  These queries can be used to determine which of those resources are consuming more credits than anticipated and take the necessary steps to reduce their consumption.</p>
<h2 class="checklist" is-upgraded>What You&#39;ll Learn</h2>
<ul class="checklist">
<li>how to analyze consumption trends and patterns</li>
<li>how to identify consumption anomolies</li>
<li>how to analyze partner tool consumption metrics</li>
</ul>
<h2 is-upgraded>What You&#39;ll Need</h2>
<ul>
<li>A <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/" target="_blank">Snowflake</a> Account</li>
<li>Access to view <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/sql-reference/account-usage.html#enabling-account-usage-for-other-roles" target="_blank">Account Usage Data Share</a></li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Query Tiers" duration="0">
        <p>Each query within the Resource Optimization Snowflake Quickstarts will have a tier designation just to the right of its name as &#34;(T*)&#34;.  The following tier descriptions should help to better understand those designations.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Tier 1 Queries</h2>
<p>At its core, Tier 1 queries are essential to Resource Optimization at Snowflake and should be used by each customer to help with their consumption monitoring - regardless of size, industry, location, etc.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Tier 2 Queries</h2>
<p>Tier 2 queries, while still playing a vital role in the process, offer an extra level of depth around Resource Optimization and while they may not be essential to all customers and their workloads, it can offer further explanation as to any additional areas in which over-consumption may be identified.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Tier 3 Queries</h2>
<p>Finally, Tier 3 queries are designed to be used by customers that are looking to leave no stone unturned when it comes to optimizing their consumption of Snowflake.  While these queries are still very helpful in this process, they are not as critical as the queries in Tier 1 &amp; 2.</p>
