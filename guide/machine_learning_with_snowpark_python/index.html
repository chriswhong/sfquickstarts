        <p><strong>Note: if this is your first time experimenting with Snowpark Python, we recommend completing the </strong><a href="https://quickstarts.snowflake.com/guide/getting_started_with_snowpark_python/index.html?index=..%2F..index#0" target="_blank"><strong>Getting Started with Snowpark for Python</strong></a><strong> Quickstart before working on this quickstart. It will include an overview of more fundamental concepts, this Quickstart is meant to be a 300+ level resource.</strong></p>
<p><em>This quickstart was initially built as a Hands-on-Lab at Snowflake Summit 2022</em></p>
<p>Python is the language of choice for Data Science and Machine Learning workloads. Snowflake has long supported Python via the Python Connector, allowing data scientists to interact with data stored in Snowflake from their preferred Python environment. This did, however, require data scientists to write verbose SQL queries. To provide a more friendly, expressive, and extensible interface to Snowflake, we built <strong>Snowpark Python</strong>, a native Python experience with a pandas and PySpark-like API for data manipulation. This includes a client-side API to allow users to write Python code in a Spark-like API without the need to write verbose SQL. Python UDF and Stored Procedure support also provides more general additional capabilities for compute pushdown.</p>
<p>Snowpark includes client-side APIs and server-side runtimes that extends Snowflake to popular programming languages including Scala, Java, and Python. Ultimately, this offering provides a richer set of tools for Snowflake users (e.g. Python&#39;s extensibility and expressiveness) while still leveraging all of Snowflake&#39;s core features, and the underlying power of SQL, and provides a clear path to production for machine learning products and workflows.</p>
<p>A key component of Snowpark for Python is that you can &#34;Bring Your Own IDE&#34;- anywhere that you can run a Python kernel, you can run client-side Snowpark Python. You can use it in your code development the exact same way as any other Python library or module. In this quickstart, we will be using Jupyter Notebooks, but you could easily replace Jupyter with any IDE of your choosing.</p>
<p>Throughout this quickstart, we will specifically explore the power of the Snowpark Python Dataframe API, as well as server-side Python runtime capabilities, and how Snowpark Python can enable and accelerate end-to-end Machine Learning workflows, from initial data and feature engineering all the way to production model deployment. We will also demonstrate how Snowpark-optimized warehouse instance types can be used to accelerate ML workflows specifically. We will even explore orchestrating model training and deployment pipelines using Apache Airflow.</p>
<p>The source code for this quickstart is available on <a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-citibike-ml-snowpark-python/tree/main" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Use-Case: Predicting Bike Share Trips" duration="1">
        <p>In this example we use the <a href="https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data" target="_blank">Citibike dataset</a>. Citibike is a bicycle sharing system in New York City. Everyday users choose from 20,000 bicycles at over 1000 stations around New York City.</p>
<p>To ensure customer satisfaction Citibike needs to predict how many bicycles will be needed at each station. Maintenance teams from Citibike will check each station and repair or replace bicycles. Additionally, the team will relocate bicycles between stations based on predicted demand. The operations team needs an application to show how many bicycles will be needed at a given station on a given day.</p>
<p>Importantly, at the end of each section of this Quickstart, we are going to export modular Python code for use in our end-to-end deployment and orchestration. This demonstrates your ability to use the IDE of your choice (in this case, Jupyter notebooks), to iterate, explore, and experiment, while still creating production-ready, deployable Python code.</p>

        <p><strong>Persona</strong>: Data Scientist</p>
<p><strong>What You&#39;ll Do</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Query daily trip data in Snowflake using Snowpark Python and visualize time-series data</li>
<li>Train a preliminary PyTorch TabNet model to predict daily trip counts</li>
<li>Augment your model feature trips data with Holiday reference data, along with weather data available in the <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/data-marketplace/?_sft_dataset-category=weather" target="_blank">Snowflake Marketplace</a></li>
<li>Consolidate final feature data into feature engineering functions and write them to a Python module for use by the ML engineering team to operationalize your model.</li>

<p><strong>Snowflake Features</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Snowpark Python Client Dataframe API for query &amp; data transformation push-down</li>
<li>Snowflake Marketplace for data enrichment</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that the data engineers have cleaned and loaded the data to the <code>trips</code> table, we can begin our model development. For this, we will leverage Snowpark to do the feature preparation and exploratory analysis. This dataset is initially ~100 million rows and is likely too large to fit into memory on our local machine or even a reasonable sized single VM in the cloud. The Snowpark Python client-side Dataframe API allows us to push-down most of the computation for preparation and feature engineering to Snowpark. For security and goverance reasons we can read data into memory for model training and inference but no intermediate data products can be stored outside of Snowflake.</p>

<p>After performing your feature engineering, you will write the feature engineering functions to a Python module for use by the ML engineering team in operationalizing this end-to-end workflow.</p>
<p>Finally, train your TabNet regression model using the final feature set and evaluate its performance, along with feature importance.</p>
<p><strong>OPTIONAL</strong>: If you also want to train an ARIMA baseline model to compare against, you can open up the <a href="https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/sfguide-citibike-ml-snowpark-python/blob/main/02_Data_Science-ARIMA-Baseline.ipynb" target="_blank">02_Data_Science-ARIMA-Baseline</a> notebook and run the cells to train a baseline ARIMA forecast model.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Conclusion" duration="2">
        <p>In this quickstart we demonstrated how Snowpark Python enables rapid, end-to-end machine learning workload development, deployment, and orchestration.</p>
<p>For the <strong>Data Engineer</strong>, Snowpark Python simplifies ELT pipeline development using common Dataframe API syntax, that also exposes the expressiveness and extensiveness of Python. Norming on Python as the language of choice also allows rapid iteration between Data Scientists and Data Engineers, eliminating any expensive code translation lift that can introduce additional time and cost to machine learning workflow development.</p>
<p>For the <strong>Data Scientist</strong>, Snowpark Python provides a familiar API for querying, acquiring, transforming, and exploring data that resides in Snowflake, while also providing the compute benefits of push-down query execution at little to zero additional time and cost. Snowpark abstracts compute away from the data scientist&#39;s IDE of choice, be that a Notebook environment, or more typical IDE. The server-side Snowpark Python runtime enables data scientists to immediately deploy training and inference code to Snowflake with a single line of code. And, all of this is done without having to write a single line of verbose SQL.</p>
<p>For the <strong>ML Engineer</strong>, Snowpark Python simplifies the hand-off of experimental/analysis code from the data scientist into production-level workflows. By simply extending the experimental code into more robust Python modules, the ML engineer can turn an ML project from experiment to product in little to no time. He or she can then orchestrate a fully operational ML pipeline using the business&#39;s orchestration tool of choice, such as Airflow in this example.</p>
<p>While mature organizations may have different individuals and roles assigned to each of these personas, repsonsible for some number of the tasks demonstrated in this Quickstart, it is common for a single Data Scientist to end up being responsible for this entire set of components. Snowpark Python provides a familiar construct for data scientists to take on additional responsibility around moving models and capabilities into produciton-ready pipelines.</p>
<p>Importantly, we showed how working in Snowpark Python allows you to &#34;Bring Your Own IDE&#34; with limited-to-zero dependencies outside of a Python kernel runtime environment, keeping things developer-friendly and allowing teams to work in their preferred dev environments.</p>
