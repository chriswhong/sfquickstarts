<h2 is-upgraded>Set up Key Pair Authentication</h2>
<p>You will have to set up Key pair authentication to utilize Snowflake APIs which are referenced below. Please follow the steps outlined here <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/key-pair-auth.html#step-1-generate-the-private-key" target="_blank">alt text</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have completed the steps above, place the public and private keys in the api-auth folder.</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Front End Viz App" duration="5">
        <p>The visualization app is a node.js front end. It is pre-built for mac and windows in the <strong>Front End/Dist</strong> folder and available for download or should you want to combile the source code is provided.</p>
<p>Once the app is downloaded and open - You will have to connect to Snowflake via the app utilizing Snowflake SQL Apis.</p>
<p>If you would like to skip the line and view the app via web please go here <a href="https://appslications.s3.amazonaws.com/dota2analysis/snowflake/index.html" target="_blank">a</a>.</p>


      </google-codelab-step>
    
      <google-codelab-step label="Connecting to Snowflake" duration="0">
        <p>Click the <strong>Token</strong> button. This will bring a pop-up like below: <img alt="alt text" src="img/d2b4c2199a730db5.png"></p>
<p>In the <strong>Snowflake API URL</strong> type the following: <strong>https://YourSFCAccount.Region.Snowflakecomputing.com/api/statements</strong>. This is so Snowflake knows where the app will route your APIs.</p>
<p>In the <strong>Snowflake Auth Token</strong> Generate a Token using the Node.js codebase in <strong>Front End/api-auth</strong>. You can also do so using python with this code here <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/sql-api/guide.html#using-key-pair-authentication" target="_blank">alt text</a>.</p>
<p>Below that Please - please position your players as necessary within the 10 input boxes. You can do this by having a select statement. Take a look at the image above as an example. Each game may have different heros that players slect and thus these inputs will change depending on which game/replay you are attempting to visualize.</p>
<p>Finally, close this input pane and then click connect in the main menu. If all is done correctly, This will connect to Snowflake and run the necessary quiries.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Viewing the Data</h2>
<p>The replay data will like below. At the top you will have a timeline of the game, where you can click on the minute to advance the game. Below that you will a second by second bar where you will get any/all events which happened in that minute. <img alt="alt text" src="img/38ea747b46945fa7.png"></p>

        <p>The Conclusion and Next Steps section is one of the most important parts of a guide. This last section helps to sum up all the information the reader has gone through, and in many ways should read like a <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/435266/what-does-tldr-mean-and-how-do-you-use-it/#post-435266:~:text=How%20Do%20You%20Use%20TLDR%3F,you%E2%80%99re%20the%20author%20or%20commenter.%20Using" target="_blank">TLDR summary</a>.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also important to remember that by the time a reader has completed a Guide, the goal is that they have actually built something! Guides teach through hands-on examples – not just explaining concepts.</p>
